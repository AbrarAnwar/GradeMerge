# GradeMerge

This program takes in two Canvas CSV grade files, a high school one and a college one, and merges them together so the grades in the high school one can be reflected on the college CSV. It essentially takes all the grades of the high school CSV file and puts them into the college CSV file based on student name and makes sure the college CSV file's unique IDs for each assignment are kept.
